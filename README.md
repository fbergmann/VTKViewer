## VTK Viewer
This application is for viewing `.pvd`, `.vtu` and `.pvtu` files. This makes it possible to analyze the files, and for each point extract a time series, or re-use date in other applications. 


## Libraries
The following open source libraries are included in this project: 

- [Ookii.Dialogs](http://www.ookii.org/) used for browsing folders, easily
- [edit-spatial](https://github.com/fbergmann/edit-spatial/) a collection of tools for dealing with spatial files
- [ActiViz .NET](http://www.kitware.com/opensource/avdownload.php) for importing `pvtu / vtu` files and some rendering.
